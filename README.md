# Handwriting-Recognition-Project
Used a trained KNN model and applied it to hand drawn inputs to identify the correct digit (0-9)
Trained model using MNIST Database
Coded a program in Java which recognized hand-drawn numbers with a 97.15% accuracy rate
Evaluated and improved accuracy rate by 0.24% by applying a heavier penalty for larger distances
